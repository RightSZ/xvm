Description: Provides tools for reading, parsing and visualizing simulation data stored in 'xvg'/'xpm' file
  formats (commonly generated by GROMACS molecular dynamics software). Streamlines post-processing
  and analysis of molecular dynamics ('MD') simulation outputs, enabling efficient exploration of
  molecular stability and conformational changes. Supports import of trajectory metrics (RMSD,
  energy, temperature) and creation of publication-ready visualizations through integration with
  'ggplot2'.
